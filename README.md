# Scum-Villany-RPG

This repo is for shared files for a Scum & Villany RPG. Why GitHub?  Well, work blocks Google products, and the built in wiki here might be useful.

# Session Scheduling
Getting a handful of adults together on a regular basis is impossible, but we're going to try our best.  I'm aiming for every other Wednesday at 7:00 PM PST on the Discord.  *I'll run if I have three people*.  I'm punctual, so out of respect for everyone else, be punctual too.  If 7:00 on the dot doesn't work for some reason, like you get home at 7:10, or Wednesdays are always a shitshow, let me know.

I like Wednesdays because they're normally a kind of lull in the week, and this gives me something to look forward to.

**First Session will be July 10!**
